# Contributing Guidelines

## Branch Naming
Use descriptive branches such as `feature/short-description` or `bugfix/issue-id`.

## Commit Messages
Write concise, imperative commit messages. Prefix with a verb and keep the first line under 50 characters.

## Pull Request Checks
Before opening a PR, run:
- `npm test`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run dev` for a quick smoke test
Ensure all checks pass and provide context in the PR description.
